 \item Describe the Problem.
 \begin{itemize}

 \item .. simple enough to be solvable
 \end{itemize}

 \begin{itemize}
 \item as bullit list with 
 \item forward references to sections where you substantiate them.

 \item Contributions are the properties of the solution.
 \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
