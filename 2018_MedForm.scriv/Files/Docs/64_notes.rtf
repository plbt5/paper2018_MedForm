\pard\plain \ql\ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 Assume a culinary application that uses concepts about vegetables, fruits, nuts, herbs and more. In order to maintain an accurate description on the individual elements, it makes use of information from a botanic data source. The latter discerns the various parts of the plant as depicted in \\cref\{fig:plant-parts\}. Unfortunately, the perspectives on what exactly is meant with fruits and vegetables is quite different between botanics and the culinary disciplines. Botanics define fruit as}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  a seed-bearing structure that develops from the ovary of a flowering plant, whereas the culinary perspective simply refers to fruit as }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 a sweet, juicy, edible part of the plant. Moreover, although botanics discern the different parts of a plant, such as roots, bulbs, tubers, leaves, stems and more, \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93vegetables\u8221\'94 do not exist in botanical terminology; at best it can be considered to refer to}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  all other parts of a plant that are not fruits. From a culinary perspective,}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0  \loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8220\'93V}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 egetable took on its current sense just a few centuries ago and essentially means a plant material that is neither fruit nor seed\loch\af0\hich\af0\dbch\af0\uc1\u8221\'94 [@McGee2004;p.247]. We summarise the clash between botanic and culinary terminology in \\cref\{}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 fig:bot-cul-venns}{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 \}.}}
