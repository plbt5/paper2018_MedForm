\pard\plain \ltrch\loch {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 The purpose of the rewriting is to transcribe data from its original ontological representation into the native representation used by the receiving agent, without introducing invalid semantics. It is our objective to reformulate our inductive model as a cTRS since this proofs that it is possible to produce a generic semantic transcription engine.}

\par\plain {\f0\fs24\b0\i0 We have made an attempt to do exactly that: reformulate our inductive model as a cTRS. However, }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 we came to the conclusion that such reformulation seems to be impossible. However, }{\f0\fs24\b0\i0 we are uncertain whether we have fully understood the mechanics of a cTRS, and would like to get a secondary opinion from an expert in Term Rewriting.}}
