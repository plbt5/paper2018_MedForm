@book{Gamut1991,
abstract = {Potts (2005, 2007) claims that Grices conventional implicatures offer a powerful argument in favor of a multidimensional semantics, one in which certain expressions fail to interact scopally with various operators because their meaning is located in a separate dimension. Focusing on Non-Restrictive Relative Clauses NRRs), we explore an alternative to Pottss bidimensional account. In our analysis, (1) NRRs can be syntactically attached with matrix scope, despite their appearance in embedded positions; (2) NRRs can in some cases be syntactically attached within the scope of other operators (whether attitudinal or not), in which case they semantically interact with them; (3) NRRs are semantically conjoined with the rest of the sentence, but (4) they are subject to a pragmatic rule that requires that their content be relatively easy to accommodate hence some non-trivial projection facts when NRRs do not have matrix scope. In this paper, we only develop (1) and (2), which pertain to the scopal behavior of NRRs. (1), which is in full agreement with the classic high attachment analysis of NRRs, shows that Pottss semantic machinery is not necessary: its effects follow from more conservative semantic assumptions once an adequate syntax is postulated. Because of (2), Pottss machinery makes incorrect predictions when NRRs have a non-matrix attachment and interact scopally with other operators. Semantic arguments for (2) were given in Wang et al. 2005 and Amaral et al. 2007, but were re-analyzed in pragmatic terms in Harris and Potts 2009a, b; we provide new evidence that suggests that in some cases the latter analysis is implausible.},

In this paper we examine different formulations of conditional equations as rewrite systems, compare their expressive power and give sufficient conditions for rewrite systems to have the “confluence” property. We then examine a restriction of these systems using a “decreasing” ordering. With this restriction, most of the basic notions (like rewriting and computing normal forms) are decidable, the “critical pair” lemma holds, and some formulations preserve canonicity.},

abstract = {Web Services offer an interoperability model thut abstracts from the idiosyncrasies of specific implementations; they were introduced to address the increasing need for seamless interoperabilitybetween systems in the Business-to-Business domain. We analyse the requirements from this domain and show that to fully address interoperability demands we need to make use of semantic descriptions of Web Services. We therefore introduce the Web Service Execution Environment (WSMX), a software system that enables the creation and execution of Semantic Web Services based on the Web Service Modelling Ontology. Providers can use it to register and offer their services and requesters can use it to dynamically discover und invoke relevant services. WSMX allows a requester to discover, mediate and invoke WebServices in order to curry out its tasks, based on services available on the Internet.},

abstract = {The task of information extraction can be seen as a problem of se- mantic matching between a user-defined template and a piece of information writ- ten in natural language. To this purpose, the ontological assumptions of the template need to be suitably specified, and compared with the ontological impli- cations of the text. So-called “ontologies”, consisting of theories of various kinds expressing the meaning of shared vocabularies, begin to be used for this task. This paper addresses the theoretical issues related to the design and use of such ontologies for purposes of information retrieval and extraction. After a dis- cussion on the nature of semantic matching within a model-theoretical frame- work, we introduce the subject of Formal Ontology, showing how the notions of parthood, integrity, identity, and dependence can be of help in understanding, organizing and formalizing fundamental ontological distinctions. We present then some basic principles for ontology design, and we illustrate a preliminary proposal for a top-level ontology develped according to such principles. As a concrete example of ontology-based information retrieval, we finally report an ongoing experience of use of a large linguistic ontology for the retrieval of ob- ject-oriented software components.},

existing heterogeneous data resources can lead to an increase in our
understanding of biological function at all levels. However, supporting
ad hoc queries across multiple data resources and correlating data
retrieved from these is still difficult. To address this, we are
building a mediator based on the functional data model database, P/FDM,
which integrates access to heterogeneous distributed biological
databases. Our architecture makes use of the existing search
capabilities and indexes of the underlying databases, without infringing
on their autonomy. Central to our design philosophy is the use of
schemas. We have adopted a federated architecture with a five-level
schema, arising from the use of the ANSI-SPARC three-level schema to
describe both the existing autonomous data resources and the mediator
itself. We describe the use of mapping functions and list comprehensions
in query splitting, producing execution plans, code generation, and
result fusion. We give an example of cross-database querying involving
data held locally in P/FDM systems and external data in SRS.},

abstract = {Heterogeneity is an inherent characteristic of open and distributed environments like the Internet that can hamper Web resources and Web services from successful interoperation. Mediation can be used to resolve these issues, which are critical problems in the Semantic Web. Appropriate technologies for mediation need to cover two aspects: first, techniques for handling the different kinds of heterogeneity that can occur between Web resources, and secondly logical components that connect resources and apply required mediation technique along with invocation and execution facilities. This paper presents an integrated model for mediation on the Semantic Web with special attention to Semantic Web services that is developed around the Web Service Modeling Ontology WSMO. Covering both dimensions, we explain the techniques developed for handling different types of heterogeneity as well as the components and architecture for establishing interoperability on the Semantic Web if not given a priori.},

Uniform information access of heterogeneous sources is of major importance for Semantic Web applications and end users. We describe a methodology for SPARQL query mediation over federated OWL/ RDF knowledge bases. The query mediation exploits mappings between semantically related entities of the global ontology and the local ontologies. A very rich set of mappings, based on Description Logic semantics, is supported. The SPARQL queries that are posed over the global ontology are decomposed, rewritten, and then submitted to the federated sources. The rewritten SPARQL queries are locally evaluated and the results are returned to the mediator. We describe the formal modeling of executable mappings (i.e. mappings that can be used in SPARQL query rewriting), as well as the theoretic and implementation aspects of SPARQL query rewriting. Finally we describe the implementation of a system supporting the mediation process.},

abstract = {Virtualization is one of the key features of the Grid. As data-intensive
applications gain on importance, it becomes crucial for the success of
the Grid to provide transparent access to distributed/heterogeneous data
sources as well. In this paper, we describe our concepts to provide a
Virtual Data Source (VDS) - a logically single homogeneous data source -
on the Grid. Various data sources like relational/XML databases and
comma separated value files can be combined via a Mapping Schema. By
allowing to invoke user defined functions during the mediation a
flexible way of resolving heterogeneities is provided. To show the
feasibility of the developed concepts and elaborate the basis for a

provide a non-proprietary, centralized and easy to integrate solution.

abstract = {Many studies have examined the integration of information systems into healthcare institutions, leading to several standards in the healthcare domain (CORBAmed: Common Object Request Broker Architecture in Medicine; HL7: Health Level Seven International; DICOM: Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine; IHE: Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise). Due to the existence of a wide diversity of heterogeneous systems, three essential factors are necessary to fully integrate a system: data, functions and workflow. However, most of the previous studies have dealt with only one or two of these factors and this makes the system integration unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose a flexible, scalable architecture for Hospital Information Systems (HIS). Our main purpose is to provide a practical solution to insure HIS interoperability so that healthcare institutions can communicate without being obliged to change their local information systems and without altering the tasks of the healthcare professionals. Our architecture is a mediation architecture with 3 levels: 1) a database level, 2) a middleware level and 3) a user interface level. The mediation is based on two central components: the Mediator and the Adapter. Using the XML format allows us to establish a structured, secured exchange of healthcare data. The notion of medical ontology is introduced to solve semantic conflicts and to unify the language used for the exchange. Our mediation architecture provides an effective, promising model that promotes the integration of hospital information systems that are autonomous, heterogeneous, semantically interoperable and platform-independent. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},
